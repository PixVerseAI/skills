## [1.12.0] - 2026-06-28

Major rewrite of the `seedance-prompt-optimize` skill into a fuller multi-modal directing model — task classification, complexity-based output routing, subject tags, an audio channel, ASCII audio/text markup, and conditional constraint packs.

### Added
- **Task classification** for `seedance-prompt-optimize` — every prompt is first sorted into multi-modal reference / edit / extend / combination, each with its own recommended sentence pattern, plus a guard against writing "reference @videoN" on edit/extend tasks (which would misclassify them).
- **Path A / Path B output routing** — simple single-scene prompts now assemble into one paragraph instead of being forced into sections; only ≥ 2-shot / multi-subject / cinematic *reference* prompts use the strict three-part structure. Complexity is judged on temporal + spatial event density, not asset count.
- **Subject-tag binding** — `<subjectN>@imageN`, or "define [2–3 stable features] as `<subjectN>`" for reuse across shots, layered on top of the existing positional `@imageN` binding.
- **Audio channel** — timbre reference, single-language consistency (with non-default-language tagging), homophone pronunciation fallback, and a tail-noise fade-out suggestion.
- **ASCII audio/text markup** — `()` background music, `<>` sound effect, `{}` dialogue, `[]` subtitle/title — plus three text-generation templates (ad copy / subtitle / speech bubble).
- **Conditional constraint packs** — quality, stability, subtitle guard, watermark/logo guard, twin/clone guard (multi-person), style anchor (anime/non-photoreal), and strong-position lock (multi-person frontal dynamic).
- **Asset best-practice guidance** — split multi-view sheets into headshot + full-body, group > 4 people before image-to-video, place precision-critical assets first, and target ~4–5 assets rather than the cap.
- Two new triage red flags — absolute-second timing, and unanchored anime / non-photoreal style.

### Changed
- **Shot timing now uses `Shot 1 / Shot 2 / …` ordering; absolute seconds (`0–3s`) are forbidden.** Seedance 2.0's precise-timing support is unstable, so the shot script is ordered, not wall-clock-timed. All examples were rewritten accordingly. (Supersedes the previous time-sliced shot script.)
- **Interruption policy reversed** in `seedance-prompt-optimize`. The skill no longer blocks on every missing element; it now stops only for four critical ambiguities (position / frame mapping, task-type misjudgment, camera-move conflict, contradictory subject features) and auto-fills non-critical gaps with transparent disclosure under "Issues Found".

## [1.11.2] - 2026-06-28

Sync the skill docs to PixVerse CLI **v1.2.5** (add `seedance-2.0-mini`), and correct stale Seedance 2.0 guidance now that audio references and real human faces are accepted.

### Added
- **Seedance 2.0 Mini (`seedance-2.0-mini`)** video model — same capabilities as `seedance-2.0-fast` (`480p` / `720p`; duration `4`–`15s`; aspect ratios `16:9` `4:3` `1:1` `3:4` `9:16` `21:9`; supports the Seedance-only `--videos` / `--audios` reference inputs and up to 9 reference images), available everywhere `seedance-2.0-fast` is (`create video`, `create reference`, `create transition`). Updated the master video-model table in `SKILL.md`, the model lists and reference tables in `create-video` and `transition`, the Seedance reference-inputs note in `character-design`, and the variant enumerations in `seedance-prompt-optimize`.

### Fixed
- **Seedance 2.0 audio input is supported.** `seedance-prompt-optimize` previously claimed PixVerse's Seedance integration does **not** accept audio references — this contradicted the skill's own Step 2 mapping. Audio is now documented as a first-class reference modality (`create reference --audios`, max 3 clips, each 2–15s, total ≤ 15s; requires ≥1 image/video reference): the pipeline note and the multi-modal-reference description now read image / video / audio and point to the `@audioN` binding flow.
- **Real human faces are accepted on Seedance 2.0.** Removed the `character-design` moderation tip that warned real human faces cause frequent Seedance rejections; most face inputs now pass moderation and are no longer blocked.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-06-23

Sync the skill docs to PixVerse CLI **v1.2.3** — add 4K (`2160p`) quality for the `seedance-2.0-standard` model.

### Added
- **Seedance 2.0 Standard 4K (`2160p`) quality** — `seedance-2.0-standard` now accepts `--quality 2160p`, available everywhere the model is supported (`create video`, `create reference`, `create transition`). Updated the master video-model table in `SKILL.md` (Max Quality `1080p` → `2160p`) and the per-mode quality lists in `create-video` and `transition`.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-06-23

Sync the skill docs to PixVerse CLI **v1.2.3** — the CLI's audio overhaul (standalone voice/music, removed lip-sync), the OSS→media-path rename, and several model/flag changes. (Versions 1.10.x are reserved for the in-progress screenplay/storyboard pipeline on a separate branch, so this release jumps 1.9.0 → 1.11.0.)

### Added
- **`pixverse:create-voice` capability** — text-to-speech (TTS) with MiniMax and ElevenLabs voices. Documents `create voice`, the read-only `voice models` / `voice presets` groups, provider-specific flags (stability/similarity/style/speaker-boost for ElevenLabs; volume/pitch/emotion for MiniMax), the 5-model registry, and `--output` download.
- **`pixverse:create-music` capability** — prompt-to-music with MiniMax (`music-2.6`), ElevenLabs (`music-v1`), and Google Lyria (`lyria-3-pro-preview`). Documents `create music`, the `music models` group, lyrics/instrumental/auto-lyrics options, Lyria image references, and duration controls.
- **Seedance 2.0 extra reference inputs** — `create reference --videos` (video references) and `--audios` (audio references), seedance-2.0 only, with the count/duration limits. Documented in `create-video`, `character-design`, and `seedance-prompt-optimize`.
- **`grok-imagine-1.5`** video model (image-to-video only) added to the master and `create-video` model tables.
- **New master commands** — `voice models`, `voice presets`, `music models`, `account slots`, `update`, and the `config defaults show|set|reset` subcommands added to the All Commands table.
- **Global `--trace-id`** flag and the common `-` (stdin) / `--idempotency-key` creation conventions documented in `SKILL.md`.
- `--type audio` documented for `asset list|info|download|delete` and `task status|wait`.

### Changed
- **Default image model is now `gpt-image-2.0`** (was incorrectly documented as `qwen-image`). Updated the master Image Models table and `create-and-edit-image`.
- **PixVerse `v6` now supports Reference (fusion)** and is the default reference model (was `pixverse-c1`). Corrected the stale "V6 does not support multi-subject reference" notes in `create-video`.
- **OSS path → media path.** Removed the deprecated `--asset-image` flag everywhere; `--image` / `--images` / `--video` now accept a file path, HTTPS URL, asset ID, or media path. Updated `create-video`, `create-and-edit-image`, `motion-control`, `seedance-prompt-optimize`, `image-to-video-pipeline`, and `motion-control-pipeline`.
- `create reference` image cap is now model-aware: 7 by default, up to 9 on seedance-2.0.
- `pixverse:post-process-video` and `pixverse:video-production` reframed around extend/upscale; voiceover and music are now generated as standalone audio assets and muxed on with `ffmpeg`.

### Removed
- **`create speech` (Lip Sync)** — removed from all docs (the command was dropped in CLI v1.2.0). The `post-process-video` "add speech" section, the `SKILL.md` command-table row, the `modify-video` / `video-production` references, and the `tts-text` / `tts-speaker` flag examples are gone. Remaining mentions are explicit "removed in v1.2.0" migration notes only.
- The stale "audio references are not supported by Seedance 2.0" note (audio references are now supported — see Added).

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-15

Sync with PixVerse CLI **v1.1.8**, which offlined the `create sound` command and dropped deprecated models from several creation modes.

### Removed
- **`create sound` command** — the sound effect reference was offlined upstream on 2026-04-17 and the CLI removed the subcommand in v1.1.8. Master `SKILL.md` "All Commands" table, `pixverse:post-process-video` (frontmatter, decision tree, dedicated `### create sound` section, and example), and the decision-tree branches in `pixverse:modify-video` have all been cleaned up.
- Sound-effect steps in workflow examples: `pixverse:video-production`, `pixverse:motion-control-pipeline`, `pixverse:modify-video-pipeline`, `pixverse:mondo-poster-to-video-pipeline`, plus the motion-control capability example and `examples/windows/powershell-text-to-video.ps1`. Pipelines now flow create → (extend / modify / motion-control) → upscale → download, with optional speech as the only audio post-process.

### Changed
- **Per-mode model whitelists tightened** to match CLI v1.1.8 validation:
  - `pixverse:create-video` (`create video` flags): dropped `v5.5`, `v5`, `v5-fast` from `--model`.
  - `pixverse:create-video` (`create reference` flags): dropped `v5`; default model is now `pixverse-c1`; added `grok-imagine` to the supported list.
  - `pixverse:post-process-video` (`create extend` flags): dropped `v5.5`, `v5`; remaining set is `v6` (default) and `grok-imagine`.
  - `pixverse:transition` (`create transition` flags): dropped `v5.5` and `v4.5` from the model list; the `v5.5` row was removed from the Transition-capable models table; added a dedicated `v5` row tagged **Multi-frame only**.
- `pixverse:transition` 3+ image constraint rewritten: only `v5` supports multi-frame transitions now (previously `v5` and `v4.5`). The V6/C1 multi-frame note now points to `v5` only, and the "use a specific model" example was switched to a valid 3-frame `v5` call (the old 2-frame `--model v5` example is no longer valid under the new whitelist).

### Added
- `seedream-5.0-lite` now supports `2160p` quality (CLI v1.1.8). Updated quality columns and "up to" phrasing in top-level `README.md`, master `SKILL.md` Model Quick Reference, `pixverse:create-and-edit-image` Model Reference + recommendation lines, and `pixverse:mondo-poster-design` Model Selection Guide.

### Fixed
- `pixverse:transition` Transition-capable models table and `--model` value list now include **Veo 3.1 Lite** (`veo-3.1-lite`, `720p` / `1080p`, durations `4` / `5` / `6`, `16:9` / `9:16`, first/last frame only). The model has been a valid transition target upstream for some time but the skill docs never reflected it. `pixverse:create-video` Model Reference table and `Veo 3.1 Lite` constraint note updated accordingly.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **`pixverse:seedance-prompt-optimize` skill** — Seedance 2.0-specific prompt optimizer for `seedance-2.0-standard` and `seedance-2.0-fast`. Model-gated with smart auto-detection: runs an 8-flag triage on every Seedance prompt and only invokes when meaningful headroom exists (missing core elements; raw paths, URLs, or `video_id` numbers in body; ambiguous multi-asset roles; camera-move conflicts; vague verbs; tokenizer-disambiguation violations; hollow filler dominance; multi-character action without position lock). Skips silently when the prompt is already clean. Produces a three-section structured rewrite (Setup → Time-Sliced Shot Script → Edit Instructions → Quality/Style/Constraint pad), grounded in the eight core elements from Volcengine's Seedance 2.0 prompt guide. Codifies canonical principles: Positional Reference Binding, Tokenizer Disambiguation, Single-Camera-Move-Per-Slice, Verb Precision Over Adjective Stacking, First-Last-Frame Anchoring, Common-Glyph Rule. For non-Seedance models, the existing `pixverse:prompt-enhance` continues to apply.
- Master `SKILL.md` capabilities table updated to register the new skill alongside `pixverse:prompt-enhance`, with the auto-trigger / skip behavior surfaced inline.

### Notes
- PixVerse's Seedance 2.0 integration does **not** accept audio as an input reference — the skill explicitly drops audio assets and avoids audio-output cues in the optimized prompt body, to stay aligned with the current pipeline surface.
- Asset references in optimized prompts bind to **positional `@imageN` / `@videoN` labels matching the CLI flag order** (`--images <p1> <p2> ...`, source video order, or `video_id`), instead of any fabricated opaque ID format.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- **`pixverse:item-design` skill** — sister skill to `pixverse:character-design` for creating and reusing persistent key items, props, and objects across stories. Cloud-first (PixVerse `image_id` as source of truth), FS + session persistence modes, v2 registry schema, hybrid field collection (`category`, `material`, `color_palette`, `size_scale`, `era_style`, `distinctive_features`, `condition`, `style_tags`), model fallback chain (`gpt-image-2.0` → `gemini-3.1-flash` → `gemini-3.0` → `seedream-5.0-lite`). Generates a 1:1 four-panel orthographic grid (front / left / top-down / right) with a pure-white #FFFFFF background. Includes panel-sizing guidance for tall items (sword, staff, rifle), long-horizontal items (motorcycle, car, boat), flat items (book, plate, phone), and cubic / spherical items. Documents the canonical "compose with character" pattern (`pixverse create image --images <character_id> <item_id> ...`).
- README capabilities/skills tree gains `character-design.md` and `item-design.md` under `capabilities/`.
- README image models table now lists **GPT Image 2** (`gpt-image-2.0`, `1080p` / `1440p` / `2160p`, per-quality aspect-ratio map). The model was added to the CLI in v1.1.4 and to SKILL.md in v1.7.2 but the README table was never synced — fixed here.
- README video models table now lists **Veo 3.1 Lite** (`veo-3.1-lite`, `720p` / `1080p`, durations `4` `5` `6`, `16:9` / `9:16`). The model was added in v1.7.0 but the README table was never synced — fixed here.

### Changed
- **`pixverse:character-design`** — prompt-template layout instruction now requires a **pure solid white (#FFFFFF) background filling the entire canvas** (no gradient, no texture, no colored tint, no studio backdrop curve). Replaces the previous "neutral light-gray studio background" wording. The same requirement is codified in `pixverse:item-design`, so a future reader can spot the contract identically in either file. Only the soft drop shadow directly under the character's feet (or under each item view) is allowed on the background.

## [1.7.3] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- `happyhorse-1.0` video model (CLI v1.1.5) — added to SKILL.md Model Quick Reference (max `1080p`, `3`–`15`s), create-video Model Reference table and constraints (Video mode only; aspect ratios `16:9` `9:16` `1:1` `4:3` `3:4`), and README video models table.
- `grok-imagine` Extend and Reference modes (CLI v1.1.6) — updated in create-video Model Reference table, constraints note, and README; also added `grok-imagine` to `create extend --model` options in post-process-video.
- `pixverse:character-design` skill — generates a three-view character sheet (front/side/back + head detail) and persists it locally for reuse across image/video generations; registered in SKILL.md skill directory table.

### Changed
- SKILL.md frontmatter description now mentions Happy Horse alongside other video model families.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `gpt-image-2.0` image model (CLI v1.1.4) — added to SKILL.md Model Quick Reference (max `2160p`) and create-and-edit-image Model Reference with per-quality aspect ratio map (`1080p`: `1:1` `3:2` `2:3` · `1440p`: `1:1` `16:9` `9:16` · `2160p`: `16:9` `9:16`), max `--count 9`, plus a dedicated example.
- `--detail-level` flag on `create image` (CLI v1.1.4) — values `low` (default) / `medium` / `high`; only valid with `--model gpt-image-2.0`. Passing it with any other model or an invalid value fails with exit code 6 (validation).
- SKILL.md Output Contract: new **Universal JSON fields** section documenting that `trace_id` is auto-injected on every `--json` object payload (success on stdout, errors on stderr) from the backend `Ai-Trace-Id` header, and that error payloads additionally carry `code` (backend `ApiError` code) and `error` (message).
- SKILL.md Output Contract and create-and-edit-image: documented the new `cost_credits` field on `create …` success payloads — present **only when the API returns a positive integer** (absent for `0` / `null` / missing); in text mode it surfaces as `Cost: N credits` after `Submitted!`.
- auth-and-account: new step 8 documenting the `PIXVERSE_ACCESS_KEY` server-to-server access key env var, including auth priority order (explicit `Token` header → stored token → `PIXVERSE_ACCESS_KEY`).

### Changed
- SKILL.md Output Contract clarifies that in `--json` mode, `pixverse task …` and `pixverse template …` error payloads now correctly route to **stderr** (CLI v1.1.4 fix), preserving the stdout-is-success contract for all commands.
- SKILL.md frontmatter description now mentions GPT Image family alongside Nano Banana / Seedream / Qwen / Kling.

### Fixed
- auth-and-account: removed stale reference to `PIXVERSE_TOKEN` env var — current CLI versions ignore it; use `PIXVERSE_ACCESS_KEY` instead.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- `veo-3.1-lite` video model (CLI v1.1.1) — added to SKILL.md Model Quick Reference and create-video Model Reference (720p / 1080p, durations 4 / 5 / 6, `16:9` and `9:16` only, Video mode only)
- `seedance-2.0-standard` now supports `1080p` quality (CLI v1.1.2) — updated quality column in SKILL.md and create-video Model Reference

### Changed
- create-video, asset-management, motion-control: documented new auto-compression behavior (CLI v1.1.3) — local images exceeding `1920×1920` or `5 MB` are auto-resized and re-encoded before upload; agents no longer need to pre-compress
- create-video, asset-management: clarified that remote inputs accept only `https://` URLs (`http://` is rejected)
- auth-and-account: documented browser auto-open behavior — interactive mode opens the authorization URL in the system default browser; `--json` / `-p` modes suppress browser opening to keep automation side-effect-free

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- 6 new video models: Seedance 2.0 Standard/Fast, Kling O3 Pro/Standard, Kling 3.0 Pro/Standard — with full parameter constraints documented in create-video, transition, and master SKILL.md
